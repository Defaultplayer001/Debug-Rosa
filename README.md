V.01. INCOMPLETE!

This is the first release, I have attempted to be as thorough as possible, however it is quite likely there are undiscovered keypresses.

Please report any strange behavior/discovered keypress/editing methods on the /r/subrosanrc subreddit or by making an issue on github!

**DebugRosa**

Welcome to the debugrosa.exe readme.txt! These are unofficial patched Sub Rosa executables that enable debug mode. Nearly all copies of Sub Rosa already have debug mode embedded inside them, they just havent been enabled.

On behalf of all [srs] I hope you enjoy!

**Credits**

NAMEREDACTED for finding debug mode and patching the executables.
Star-LoRED (/u/Defaultplayer001) for writing an in-depth documentation for debug mode.
**Supported versions**

0.25
**Important Note**

The download link is hosted separatley from GitHub for security reasons. The modified executables are the sole property of Cryptic Sea, and are to be used for educational purposes only. We are not responsible and do not condone any malicious activity used with these modified executables.

**Installation****

Simply place each executable in your Sub Rosa root directory.

It should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sub Rosa

Note on custom textures: The editor will load any textures of the right file type/size located in the /data/textures directory. So fully custom textures ARE possible. However, it is not as simple as click to add, it's really finicky, but there is a method. I will research more and post a reliable method.
